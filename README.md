# challenge-5-work-day-scheduler

## Description

- What was your motivation?
The motivation behind the project was to use dayjs() in order to format and stylize a work day scheduler as well as using local storage to save events.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
The project was built to practice using jQuery, JavaScript, and dayjs() to make a functiona schedule that can save events typed into the hour blocks by the press of a save button.

- What problem does it solve?
This project solves the problem of making a functional, stylized, and responsive system that indicates the current time block and savable events.

- What did you learn?
From this assignment, I have learned the different ways in which dayjs() functions, how it can be used to display dates and time that change in real time as opposed to hard coding dates. I also learned how to target specific ids in a loop and how to compare them based on the current hour. In addition, the concepts of key/value pairs and loops have become more clear and easier to understand as well as the simplified way that jQuery operates.


## Usage

The planner is accessed via a web browser and will display the current day of the week, month, and day number. The hour block in red represents the current hour while the blocks in gray represent the past hours and the blocks in green represent the future hours. When text is entered into the text area and the save button is pressed, the event is saved, even upon page refresh.
